# Hangman Project
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## What is the Hangman Game?
 The hangman game is a guessing game, popular with programming languages.
 - A word list is created.
 - The user is asked to choose a word or letter to match any letters or words in the word list.
 - The user can have limited or unlimited guesses before either getting the word right or running out of chances.


This project showcases that the author has learned the use of functions, classes, methods, docstrings and Github.
The code is updated continuously using git commit to a branch named new_branch_1, the first file milestone_2 was not committed before
milestone_3: This has been done recursively.

This project, which is the second project within my AICore bootcamp journey also tests my ability to use Github for version control.
The first file created was milestone_2.py, but this was committed after the second file milestone_3.py (mistakes happen), from milestone_3.py to milestone_5.py have been committed in the right order. 
There are three branches: the main and two branches, viz., new_branch_1 and new_branch_2.
After commiting the latest file which is milestone_5.py to new_branch_2, this will be merged with the main branch, signifying that the project is complete!
